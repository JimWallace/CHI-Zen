abstract = {BACKGROUND Adolescence and early adulthood are critical periods for the development of mental disorders. Online peer-to-peer communication is popular among young people and may improve mental health by providing social support. Previous systematic reviews have targeted Internet support groups for adults with mental health problems, including depression. However, there have been no systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of online peer-to-peer support in improving the mental health of adolescents and young adults. OBJECTIVE The aim of this review was to systematically identify available evidence for the effectiveness of online peer-to peer support for young people with mental health problems. METHODS The PubMed, PsycInfo, and Cochrane databases were searched using keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Retrieved abstracts (n=3934) were double screened and coded. Studies were included if they (1) investigated an online peer-to-peer interaction, (2) the interaction discussed topics related to mental health, (3) the age range of the sample was between 12 to 25 years, and (4) the study evaluated the effectiveness of the peer-to-peer interaction. RESULTS Six studies satisfied the inclusion criteria for the current review. The studies targeted a range of mental health problems including depression and anxiety (n=2), general psychological problems (n=1), eating disorders (n=1), and substance use (tobacco) (n=2). The majority of studies investigated Internet support groups (n=4), and the remaining studies focused on virtual reality chat sessions (n=2). In almost all studies (n=5), the peer support intervention was moderated by health professionals, researchers or consumers. Studies employed a range of study designs including randomized controlled trials (n=3), pre-post studies (n=2) and one randomized trial. Overall, two of the randomized controlled trials were associated with a significant positive outcome in comparison to the control group at post-intervention. In the remaining four studies, peer-to-peer support was not found to be effective. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review identified an overall lack of high-quality studies examining online peer-to-peer support for young people. Given that peer support is frequently used as an adjunct to Internet interventions for a variety of mental health conditions, there is an urgent need to determine the effectiveness of peer support alone as an active intervention.},

abstract = {"Preface This book is the result of several years of hard work developing and evaluating the use of the Internet in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It started when two students from the psychology program in Uppsala, Sweden, knocked on my door and asked me if I could supervise their final Master of Science thesis for their psychology diplomas. The idea they had sounded odd, but I hesitated for only a few minutes. We then planned one of the first trials in the world on Internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) for headache. I am of course forever grateful that they came to my room, and later one of them and several other psychology students ended up writing their theses and completing their PhDs on the topic of ICBT. One of them - now professor - Per Carlbring - became a close co-worker, and without him much of the work would never have been completed. Then followed other talented students, research students and clinicians who all have contributed much to the development of the field. I would love to list them all (which would mean several extra pages), but you can get a hunch of who they are by the research papers referenced in this book. Some have worked with me for a while and invested a lot of their time creating the systems and programming. Others are extremely skilled as clinicians, treatment developers, methodologists, and believe it or not there are even those who have all of these skills (and come from Iceland ...)"--Provided by publisher.},

abstract = {To assess the direct cost of relapse and the predictors of relapse during the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in the United States. Data were drawn from a prospective, observational, noninterventional study of schizophrenia in the United States (US-SCAP) conducted between 7/1997 and 9/2003. Patients with and without relapse in the prior 6 months were compared on total direct mental health costs and cost components in the following year using propensity score matching method. Baseline predictors of subsequent relapse were also assessed. Of 1,557 participants with eligible data, 310 (20{\%}) relapsed during the 6 months prior to the 1-year study period. Costs for patients with prior relapse were about 3 times the costs for patients without prior relapse. Relapse was associated with higher costs for inpatient services as well as for outpatient services and medication. Patients with prior relapse were younger and had onset of illness at earlier ages, poorer medication adherence, more severe symptoms, a higher prevalence of substance use disorder, and worse functional status. Inpatient costs for patients with a relapse during both the prior 6 months and the follow-up year were 5 times the costs for patients with relapse during the follow-up year only. Prior relapse was a robust predictor of subsequent relapse, above and beyond information about patients' functioning and symptom levels. Despite the historical decline in utilization of psychiatric inpatient services, relapse remains an important predictor of subsequent relapse and treatment costs for persons with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Can an avatar's body movements change a person's perception of good and bad? We discuss virtual embodiment according to theories of embodied cognition (EC), and afferent and sensorimotor correspondences. We present an example study using virtual reality (VR) to test EC theory, testing the effect of altered virtual embodiment on perception. Participants either controlled an avatar whose arm movements were similar to their own or reflected the mirror opposite of their arm movements. We measured their associations of ''good'' and ''bad'' with the left and right (i.e., space-valence associations). This study demonstrated how VR could be used to examine the possible ways that systems of the body (e.g., visual, motor) may interact to influence cognition. The implications of this research suggest that visual feedback alone is not enough to alter space-valence associations. Multiple sensory experiences of media (i.e., sensorimo-tor feedback) may be necessary to influence cognition, not simply visual feedback. 1 Introduction From being swept away by characters in a book, or feeling heart palpitations while playing a first-person shooter videogame, users' minds and bodies connect with mediated environments. Media-technology provides users with dynamic interactive experiences. An embodied cognition (EC) framework may explain why humans get absorbed in mediated experiences in sensory (e.g., visual feedback on a screen) and nonsensory environments (e.g., text in a physical book). According to an EC approach, cognition is grounded in the body and in the body's relationship to the environment. Mental representations are stored through a multimodal system (various systems of the body) that integrates memory, perception (e.g., vision), action (e.g., movement), and introspection (e.g., emotion; Barsalou, 2008, 2010). Humans spend substantial portions of their day navigating highly interactive media environments. The capabilities of new media-technology allow for greater mapping of interfaces to human body movements. For example, using a home video game console system is no longer a static experience involving abstract motions (i.e., a button press) that simulate movement in a virtual environment. Instead, game play can reflect the user's body movements in real time with controls that capture the player's body movements. Phone and tablet interfaces have become more user friendly by employing direct motions for control, such as a simple flick of the wrist, or the swipe of a few fingertips. Integrating interface},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Brown et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.Background: Only 30-35{\%} of people with mental health problems seek help from professionals. Informal help, usually from friends, family and religious leaders, is often sought but is under-researched. This study aimed to contrast patterns of informal and formal help-seeking using data from a community psychiatric morbidity survey (n=1692) (South East London Community Health (SELCOH) Study).Methods: Patterns of help-seeking were analysed by clinical, sociodemographic and socioeconomic indicators. Factors associated with informal and formal help-seeking were investigated using logistic regression. Cross-tabulations examined informal help-seeking patterns from different sources.Results: 'Cases' (n = 386) were participants who had scores of ≥ 12 on the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R), indicating a common mental disorder. Of these, 40.1{\%} had sought formal help, (of whom three-quarters (29{\%}) had also sought informal help), 33.6{\%} had sought informal help only and only 26.3{\%} had sought no help. When controlling for non-clinical variables, severity, depression, suicidal ideas, functioning and longstanding illnesses were associated with formal rather than informal help-seeking. Age and ethnic group influenced sources of informal help used. Younger people most frequently sought informal help only whereas older people tended to seek help from their family. There were ethnic group differences in whether help was sought from friends, family or religious leaders.Conclusions: This study has shown how frequently informal help is used, whether in conjunction with formal help or not. Among the 'cases', over 60{\%} had sought informal help, whether on its own or together with formal help. Severity was associated with formal help-seeking. Patterns of informal help use have been found. The use and effectiveness of informal help merit urgent research.},

We report on a study comparing a novel intervention of seeking support from one's social network to the more common approaches of expressive writing and studying task-relevant materials for simulated open-ended test questions. We measured in-the-moment (state) anxiety before and after each intervention, and correctness of the solutions. We also surveyed students to learn about their perceptions of the interventions. Our results showed that social support decreased the anxiety of high test-anxious students by 21{\%} with the reduction in anxiety correlating with the number of messages received. Social support also allowed high test-anxious students to score at the level of low test-anxious students. Expressive writing showed a similar effect, but increased the anxiety of low test-anxious students by 61{\%}. Studying task materials had no effect on anxiety and high test-anxious students performed worse than low test-anxious students. Despite benefiting from social support, we found that students were uncomfortable soliciting support from their online social network.

In this paper, we report on a study investigating these issues through a questionnaire administered to more than a hundred users of three virtual worlds offering widely different avatar creation and customization systems (Maple Story, World of Warcraft, and Second Life).

abstract = {Abstract Background: Serious games are computer or video games that contain elements that are specifically designed for the purpose of education or training. Serious games are increasingly being used within healthcare, but their introduction into and application in psychotherapeutic settings as an e-mental health treatment modality raises questions for both patients and therapists. Current research demonstrates the potential role and effectiveness of serious games within a psychotherapeutic context. However, a limited understanding of patients' and therapists' existing knowledge and experience of serious games, as well as of their readiness to utilize and apply them for the treatment of psychological conditions, requires further investigation. Materials and Methods: Acceptance, experience, and requirements for the utilization of serious games in therapeutic contexts were assessed through online surveys with German-speaking patients (n?=?260) and psychotherapists (n?=?234). Respondents' answers were analyzed by a combination of descriptive and inferential statistics by using SPSS. Results: Current knowledge regarding serious games was very limited, with only 10.4{\%} of patients and 11.5{\%} of therapists reporting existing knowledge. However, a general openness toward the concept was observed: 88{\%} of patients and 90{\%} of therapists could envisage a therapeutic use. Patients (rs?=?0.169, p?=?0.006) who self-rated their level of computer and video game expertise as high were more likely to consider use within psychotherapy, compared with patients who self-rated their expertise as low. Therapists who currently play computer and video games perceive fewer disadvantages of serious game application in a psychotherapeutic context (p?=?0.097). Consideration of serious game use was differentiated by the therapeutic approach (p?=?0.003), specific mental disorders (highest rated relevant cases: anxiety disorders, affective disorders, disorders regarding impulse control, and adjustment disorders), and patient age (i.e., use with young adults was deemed the most appropriate by 91.8{\%} of therapists). Conclusion: The application of serious games is conceivable for patients and therapists, especially as a complementary element to traditional face-to-face psychotherapy. Acceptance is strongly related to therapeutic context. Only a small number of therapists and patients agree on the possibility of using a serious game instead of face-to-face therapy.},

abstract = {Introduction: In the evolving digital age, media applications are
increasingly playing a greater role in the field of psychotherapy. While
the Internet is already in the phase of being established when it comes
to the care of mental disorders, experimentation is going on with other
modern media such as serious games. A serious game is a game in which
education and behavior change is the goal, alongside with entertainment.
Objective: The objective of the present article was to provide a first
empirical overview of serious games applied to psychotherapy and
psychosomatic rehabilitation.
Method: Therefore, a systematic literature search, including the terms
serious game or computer game and psychotherapy or rehabilitation or
intervention or mental disorders in the databases Medline and PsycINFO,
was performed. Subsequently, an Internet search was conducted to
identify studies not published in journals. Publications not providing
empirical data about effectiveness were excluded.
Results: On the basis of this systematic literature review, the results
of N = 15 studies met inclusion criteria. They utilized primarily
cognitive behavioral techniques and can be useful for treating a range
of mental disorders. Serious games are effective both as a stand-alone
intervention or part of psychotherapy and appeal to patients independent
of age and sex.
Conclusion: Included serious games proved to be an effective therapeutic
component. Nonetheless, findings are not conclusive and more research is
needed to further investigate the effectiveness of serious games for
psychotherapeutic purposes.},

abstract = {Computer games are ubiquitous and can be utilized for serious purposes such as health and education. "Applied games" including serious games (in brief, computerized games for serious purposes) and gamification (gaming elements used outside of games) have the potential to increase the impact of mental health internet interventions via three processes. First, by extending the reach of online programs to those who might not otherwise use them. Second, by improving engagement through both game-based and "serious" motivational dynamics. Third, by utilizing varied mechanisms for change, including therapeutic processes and gaming features. In this scoping review, we aim to advance the field by exploring the potential and opportunities available in this area. We review engagement factors which may be exploited and demonstrate that there is promising evidence of effectiveness for serious games for depression from contemporary systematic reviews. We illustrate six major categories of tested applied games for mental health (exergames, virtual reality, cognitive behavior therapy-based games, entertainment games, biofeedback, and cognitive training games) and demonstrate that it is feasible to translate traditional evidence-based interventions into computer gaming formats and to exploit features of computer games for therapeutic change. Applied games have considerable potential for increasing the impact of online interventions for mental health. However, there are few independent trials, and direct comparisons of game-based and non-game-based interventions are lacking. Further research, faster iterations, rapid testing, non-traditional collaborations, and user-centered approaches are needed to respond to diverse user needs and preferences in rapidly changing environments.},

abstract = {This essay examines the aesthetic construction of nostalgia in the cover art of the Advanced Adventures, a series of tabletop fantasy role-playing modules published by Expeditious Retreat Press between 2006 and 2011. The art of these modules reveals a genre and period-specific set of aesthetic codes with distinct subcultural rules of application. In order to construct a sense of nostalgia, the cover art highlights the representation of adventurers, monsters, and dungeon environments within a unique visual style reminiscent of the early Dungeons and Dragons (D{\&}D) aesthetic from the late 1970s and the early 1980s. The Advanced Adventures use nostalgia ideo- logically as a form of homage to early D{\&}D, to assert the values of old-school gam- ing, and to chart a new direction for classic fantasy role-playing that challenges the style of play espoused by the current fourth edition of D{\&}D (4E) published by Wizards of the Coast.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current mental health policy emphasises the importance of service user involvement in the delivery of care. Information Technology can have an effect on quality and efficiency of care. AIMS: The aim of this study is to gain the viewpoint of service users from a local mental health service in developing a mental health app. METHOD: A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Eight volunteers aged 18-49 years were interviewed with the aid of a semi-structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Interviewees defined a good app by its ease of use. Common themes included availability of contact information, identifying triggers, the ability to rate mood/anxiety levels on a scale, guided relaxation techniques, and the option to personalise the app. The researchers will aim to produce an app that is easily accessible, highly personalisable and will include functions highlighted as important (i.e. contact information, etc.). CONCLUSIONS: This research will assist in the development of an easy-to-use app that could increase access to services, and allow service users to take an active role in their care. In previous studies, apps were developed without the involvement of service users. This study recognises the important role of service users in this area.},

abstract = {This study presents the second phase of a series of experiments investigating the impact of avatar visual fidelity on the sense of embodiment and users' behavior in immersive virtual environments. Our main focus concerns the similarity between users and avatars, a factor known as truthfulness. Our experiment requires the participants to control three avatars using a third-person perspective: a robot, a suit and their virtual doppelganger (virtual representation of the self). In order to analyze users' reactions and strategies, each task of the scenario of the virtual reality application can potentially affect the integrity of their characters. Our results revealed that ownership, one of the three factors of the sense of embodiment, is higher for the participants controlling their self-representation than with abstract representations. Furthermore, avatar visual fidelity seems to affect users' subjective experience, half of the panel reported having different behavior depending on the controlled character. Abstract representations allow the users to adopt more risky behaviors, while self-representations maintain a connection with the real world and encourage users to preserve the integrity of their avatar.},

abstract = {A number of recent authors have compared acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and traditional cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The present article describes ACT as a distinct and unified model of behavior change, linked to a specific strategy of scientific development, which we term "contextual behavioral science." We outline the empirical progress of ACT and describe its distinctive development strategy. A contextual behavioral science approach is an inductive attempt to build more adequate psychological systems based on philosophical clarity; the development of basic principles and theories; the development of applied theories linked to basic ones; techniques and components linked to these processes and principles; measurement of theoretically key processes; an emphasis on mediation and moderation in the analysis of applied impact; an interest in effectiveness, dissemination, and training; empirical testing of the research program across a broad range of areas and levels of analysis; and the creation of a more effective scientific and clinical community. We argue that this is a reasonable approach, focused on long-term progress, and that in broad terms it seems to be working. ACT is not hostile to traditional CBT, and is not directly buoyed by whatever weaknesses traditional CBT may have. ACT should be measured at least in part against its own goals as specified by its own developmental strategy. ?? 2011 Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies.},

abstract = {Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is common, debilitating and associated with high societal costs. The disorder can be effectively treated with Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT), but no previous study has investigated the long-term clinical or health economic effects of ICBT for SAD in comparison to an evidence-based control treatment. The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ICBT compared to cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) four years post-treatment. We conducted a 4-year follow-up study of participants who had received ICBT or CBGT for SAD within the context of a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial. The cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted taking a societal perspective. Participants in both treatment groups made large improvements from baseline to 4-year follow-up on the primary outcome measure (d=1.34-1.48) and the 95{\%} CI of the mean difference on the primary outcome was well within the non-inferiority margin. ICBT and CBGT were similarly cost-effective and both groups reduced their indirect costs. We conclude that ICBT for SAD yields large sustainable effects and is at least as long-term effective as CBGT. Intervention costs of both treatments are offset by net societal cost reductions in a short time. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The goal of this review was to provide a comprehensive survey of meta-analyses examining the efficacy of CBT. We identified 269 meta-analytic studies and reviewed of those a representative sample of 106 meta-analyses examining CBT for the following problems: substance use disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, depression and dysthymia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, eating disorders, insomnia, personality disorders, anger and aggression, criminal behaviors, general stress, distress due to general medical conditions, chronic pain and fatigue, distress related to pregnancy complications and female hormonal conditions. Additional meta-analytic reviews examined the efficacy of CBT for various problems in children and elderly adults. The strongest support exists for CBT of anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, bulimia, anger control problems, and general stress. Eleven studies compared response rates between CBT and other treatments or control conditions. CBT showed higher response rates than the comparison conditions in 7 of these reviews and only one review reported that CBT had lower response rates than comparison treatments. In general, the evidence-base of CBT is very strong. However, additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of CBT for randomized-controlled studies. Moreover, except for children and elderly populations, no meta-analytic studies of CBT have been reported on specific subgroups, such as ethnic minorities and low income samples.},

Being a boundary-spanning subject by nature, it also attracts interest from scholars from diverse non-IS communities, including education, marketing and business administration. In this paper we develop a research agenda for gamification which explicitly takes into account the important role of theory. An interdisciplinary expert panel evaluated and selected theories being relevant for gamification and subsequently derived research questions. Based on the respective theoretical background the resulting questions cover different aspects of the gamification domain. We conclude that taking a multi-theoretical perspective in the creation of a research agenda helps to produce a holistic picture, which allows classifying subsequent research and helps in structuring a domain.},

abstract = {Public health workers in local health departments frequently rate skills needed to address social determinants of health among their top training needs. These workers have the ability to impact social determinants of health, but many may believe this responsibility is not part of their job description or that they do not have the necessary skills or resources. Guided by the Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion and employing the case study method of instruction, the Region 2 Public Health Training Center designed a 45-minute, self-paced, online training module, titled Strategies to Advance Health Equity: How Health Departments Can Promote Living Wages, to persuade public health workers that addressing social determinants of health, especially those related to income disparities, is part of their day-to-day responsibilities. This article describes the module design, promising preliminary assessment data, and the formal evaluation plan.},

abstract = {This chapter outlines the two basic routes to persuasion. One route is based on the thoughtful consideration of arguments central to the issue, whereas the other is based on the affective associations or simple inferences tied to peripheral cues in the persuasion context. This chapter discusses a wide variety of variables that proved instrumental in affecting the elaboration likelihood, and thus the route to persuasion. One of the basic postulates of the Elaboration Likelihood Model—that variables may affect persuasion by increasing or decreasing scrutiny of message arguments—has been highly useful in accounting for the effects of a seemingly diverse list of variables. The reviewers of the attitude change literature have been disappointed with the many conflicting effects observed, even for ostensibly simple variables. The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) attempts to place these many conflicting results and theories under one conceptual umbrella by specifying the major processes underlying persuasion and indicating the way many of the traditionally studied variables and theories relate to these basic processes. The ELM may prove useful in providing a guiding set of postulates from which to interpret previous work and in suggesting new hypotheses to be explored in future research. {\textcopyright} 1986 Academic Press Inc.},

@article{Nkunya2017,
abstract = {Graphic health warning on cigarette packages is the latest initiative to
encourage cessation and reduce smoking uptake, nevertheless, it is not
clear on how effective this approach can inform and change smoking
behavior. The role of recipient factors influencing the processing of
anti-smoking messages on cigarette packs is also unclear. This paper
attempts to investigate these gaps by studying how cigarette pack
graphical health warning messages and positive gain-framed statements
are processed, and its impact on smoker's attitude using the
information-processing theory of elaboration likelihood. Two models were
developed for this experimental study. The first model focused on
elaboration levels as determinants of attitude towards smoking. A total
of 60 private college students were selected for this study. A 2x2
factorial experimental design was used to test the influence of
elaboration (IV) on attitude towards smoking (DV). The second model
tested the effect of four recipient factors on elaboration likelihood,
the factors are: general health consciousness, need for cognition,
personal relevance and prior knowledge. A two-way between subjects ANOVA
was used to test the first model which had three null hypotheses. The
two-way between subjects ANOVA test showed that recipients who scored
high on elaboration had a stronger attitude against smoking due to the
additional gain-framed arguments presented on the cigarette pack, while
those who scored low on the elaboration had stronger attitudes against
smoking based on the gruesome graphic health warning. Pearson
Correlation Coefficient test was used for the second model and the
outcome showed that only one factor that is personal relevance was
strongly correlated with elaboration, the other factors were weakly
correlated.},

abstract = {The concept of social exclusion has recently gained more attention in the context of online social interactions. However, there is only little data regarding the impact of virtual social exclusion on subsequent real-life social behaviors. Thus, this study set out to examine a virtual version of the common social exclusion scenario, the Cyberball-Paradigm (Williams {\&} Jarvis, 2006), and test for behavioral consequences in a sample of 45 students. Both the virtual characters' agency and the experience of social presence were controlled for. Findings indicate that ostracized individuals show less prosocial behavior in a helping task and keep more seating distance to a confederate than included participants. Also, virtual social exclusion constitutes a significant threat to fundamental human needs like social control, self-esteem and belonging and causes an increase in uncertainty, sadness and anger as well as a decrease in happiness. Avatars and agents seemed to equally endanger human needs and lead to the same seating distance. However, avatar excluded persons also had higher levels of sadness and were less helpful than avatar included persons, who in turn were more confident. Thus, while the Media Equation Concept (Nass {\&} Moon, 2000) holds true for the immediate reaction to social exclusion (i.e., avatars and agents equally threaten fundamental needs), the delayed emotional and behavioral reactions differ for avatars and agents, possibly because they are preceded by cognitive evaluation (c.f.,Temporal Need-Threat Model; Williams, 2009). Implications of these findings for everyday online social interactions (i.e., in MMORPGs) are discussed.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate two interventions based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for depressive symptoms: A face-to-face treatment (ACT group) was compared to a guided self-help treatment delivered via the Internet consisting of two assessment sessions (pre and post) and an ACT-based Internet program (iACT). Outpatients experiencing at least mild depressive symptoms were randomized to either approach. The iACT treatment group received access to an ACT-based Internet program and supportive web-based contact over a period of 6 weeks. The face-to-face group received ACT-based treatment once a week over the same period of time. In both groups, the results showed a significant effect on depression symptomatology, and general wellbeing after treatment and at the 18-month follow-up. However, the data indicated that the iACT group changed differently regarding depressive symptoms and wellbeing as compared to the face-to face ACT group. Results showed large pre-treatment to 18-month follow-up within-group effect sizes for all symptom measures in the iACT treatment group (1.59-2.08), and for most outcome measures in the face-to-face ACT group (1.12-1.37). This non-inferiority study provides evidence that guided Internet-delivered ACT intervention can be as effective as ACT-based face-to-face treatment for outpatients reporting depressive symptoms, and it may offer some advantages over a face-to-face intervention. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION The development and use of serious games for mental health disorders are on the rise. Yet, little is known about the impact of these games on clinical mental health symptoms. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of serious games on symptoms of mental disorder. METHOD We conducted a systematic search in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases, using mental health and serious games-related keywords. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review, and nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS All of the serious games were provided via personal computer, mostly on CD-ROM without the need for an internet connection. The studies targeted age groups ranging from 7 to 80 years old. The serious games focused on symptoms of depression (n = 2), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 2), autism spectrum disorder (n = 2), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 1), cognitive functioning (n = 2), and alcohol use disorder (n = 1). The studies used goal-oriented (n = 4) and cognitive training games (n = 6). A total of 674 participants were included in the meta-analysis (380 in experimental and 294 in control groups). A meta-analysis of 9 studies comprising 10 comparisons, using a random effects model, showed a moderate effect on improvement of symptoms [g = 0.55 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.28-0.83); P {\textless} 0.001], favoring serious games over no intervention controls. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION Though the number of comparisons in the meta-analysis was small, these findings suggest that serious gaming interventions may be effective for reducing disorder-related symptoms. More studies are needed in order to attain deeper knowledge of the efficacy for specific mental disorders and the longer term effects of this new type of treatment for mental disorders.},

abstract = {Men are more reluctant to seek help for their problems than women. This difference is attributed to social expectations regarding the male gender role. Today, help-seeking is moving online: instead of traditional peer groups and counselors, people depend on online communities and e-counselors. But online users can appear in guises that differ from their physical sex. An empirical study was conducted in an online game to examine whether users' avatars' gender influences how they seek and receive help. Analysis is based on user-to-user communications and back-end data. Results indicate that male avatars are less likely to receive sought-for help than female avatars and more likely to be the recipients of indirectly sought help. The authors conclude that avatar gender influences help seeking independent of physical sex: Men overcome their inhibition for help seeking when using female avatars. Practitioners should ensure that means for indirect help seeking are available in order not to exclude male-pattern help seekers.},

This randomised controlled trial will investigate the effects of a transdiagnostic, Internet-administered cognitive behavioural (iCBT) self-help program for anxiety, supplemented with a smartphone application. The effect of added therapist support will also be studied. Methods/Design: One hundred and fifty participants meeting diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder and/or panic disorder will be evenly randomised to either one of three study groups: 1, smartphone-supplemented iCBT with therapist support; 2, smartphone-supplemented iCBT without therapist support; or 3, an active waiting list control group with delayed treatment. Primary outcome measure will be the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item self-rating scale. Secondary measures include other anxiety, depression and quality of life measures. In addition to pre-and post-treatment measurements, the study includes two mid-treatment (days 24 and 48) and two follow-up assessments (12 and 36 months) to assess rapid and long-term effects.

As the population's age increases, the healthcare workforce is becoming progressively unable to meet the high healthcare demands of the elderly population. Increasingly, technology is being used to solve this dilemma. Using a sample from the general population (n = 65), this study examined how people interacted with either a robot or a tablet computer delivering healthcare instructions. During this interaction, the robot/tablet asked them several health-related questions, and to perform limited physical tests and a relaxation exercise. Results showed participants had more positive interactions with the robot compared to the computer tablet, including increased speech and positive emotion (smiling), and participation in the relaxation exercise. Further results showed the robot was rated higher on scales of trust, enjoyment, and desire for future interaction. This suggests that robots may offer benefits over and above computer tablets in delivering healthcare. These results further demonstrate that the physical nature of technology is important in determining responses to healthcare interactions.},

Persons labeled with psychiatric disability have become victims of social and cultural ostracism and consequently have developed a sense of self that reinforces the "patient" identity. Enabling members of peer support to understand the nature and impact of these cultural forces leads individuals and peer communities toward a capacity for personal, relational, and social change.

abstract = {AIMS People with serious mental illness are increasingly turning to popular social media, including Facebook, Twitter or YouTube, to share their illness experiences or seek advice from others with similar health conditions. This emerging form of unsolicited communication among self-forming online communities of patients and individuals with diverse health concerns is referred to as peer-to-peer support. We offer a perspective on how online peer-to-peer connections among people with serious mental illness could advance efforts to promote mental and physical wellbeing in this group. METHODS In this commentary, we take the perspective that when an individual with serious mental illness decides to connect with similar others online it represents a critical point in their illness experience. We propose a conceptual model to illustrate how online peer-to-peer connections may afford opportunities for individuals with serious mental illness to challenge stigma, increase consumer activation and access online interventions for mental and physical wellbeing. RESULTS People with serious mental illness report benefits from interacting with peers online from greater social connectedness, feelings of group belonging and by sharing personal stories and strategies for coping with day-to-day challenges of living with a mental illness. Within online communities, individuals with serious mental illness could challenge stigma through personal empowerment and providing hope. By learning from peers online, these individuals may gain insight about important health care decisions, which could promote mental health care seeking behaviours. These individuals could also access interventions for mental and physical wellbeing delivered through social media that could incorporate mutual support between peers, help promote treatment engagement and reach a wider demographic. Unforeseen risks may include exposure to misleading information, facing hostile or derogatory comments from others, or feeling more uncertain about one's health condition. However, given the evidence to date, the benefits of online peer-to-peer support appear to outweigh the potential risks. CONCLUSION Future research must explore these opportunities to support and empower people with serious mental illness through online peer networks while carefully considering potential risks that may arise from online peer-to-peer interactions. Efforts will also need to address methodological challenges in the form of evaluating interventions delivered through social media and collecting objective mental and physical health outcome measures online. A key challenge will be to determine whether skills learned from peers in online networks translate into tangible and meaningful improvements in recovery, employment, or mental and physical wellbeing in the offline world.},

abstract = {Content analysis of video games has consistently shown that women are portrayed much less frequently than men and in subordinate roles, often in "hypersexualized" ways. However, the relationship between portrayal of female characters and videogame sales has not previously been studied. In order to assess the cultural influence of video games on players, it is important to weight differently those games seen by the majority of players (in the millions), rather than a random sample of all games, many of which are seen by only a few thousand people. Box art adorning the front of video game boxes is a form of advertising seen by most game customers prior to purchase and should therefore predict sales if indeed particular depictions of female and male characters influence sales. Using a sample of 399 box art cases from games with ESRB ratings of Teen or Mature released in the US during the period of 2005 through 2010, this study shows that sales were positively related to sexualization of non-central female characters among cases with women present. In contrast, sales were negatively related to the presence of any central female characters (sexualized or non-sexualized) or the presence of female characters without male characters present. These findings suggest there is an economic motive for the marginalization and sexualization of women in video game box art, and that there is greater audience exposure to these stereotypical depictions than to alternative depictions because of their positive relationship to sales.},

Results supported the notion that gender-matched avatars increase the likelihood of gender-typical language use, whereas gender-mismatched avatars promoted countertypical language, especially among women. The gender of a partner's avatar, however, did not influence participants' language.

Experiment 1 shows that, after virtual group discussions, participants using black-cloaked avatars developed more aggressive intentions and attitudes but less group cohesion than those using white-cloaked avatars. In Experiment 2, individual participants using a Ku Klux Klan (KKK)-associated avatar created more aggressive Thematic Apperception Test stories in comparison to a control group. Participants using the KKK avatar also wrote less affiliative stories in comparison to those employing avatars dressed as doctors. Overall, the resulting pattern of activation of negative thoughts (i.e., aggression) coupled with the inhibition of inconsistent thoughts (i.e., cohesion, affiliation) is consistent with principles of current priming models and provides initial evidence for automatic cognitive priming in virtual settings.},

To counteract such potential effects, we explore the moderating role of avatar self-relevance in avatar-induced stereotype threat effects. Specifically, we examine how avatar customization (i.e., designing an avatar) and avatar-body connection (i.e., the perception that the avatar is incorporated into body schema) interact with avatar gender to influence user's post-game behavior in ways that conform to gendered stereotypes. In an experimental study (N = 64, all female), participants completed a competitive math task after playing a digital sword-fighting game. For participants who customized an avatar and experienced low avatar embodiment, those who used male avatar performed better at the math task than those who used a female avatar. These findings extend our understanding of avatar use effects, especially as they relate to avatar self-relevance, avatar customization, avatar embodiment, and stereotype threat, thereby providing insights into the ways that digital games can be designed to maximize positive outcomes for players in a variety of meaningful contexts.},

abstract = {In the burgeoning field of e-mental health interventions, avatars are increasingly being utilized to facilitate online communication between clients and therapists, and amongst peers. Avatars are digital self-representations which enable individuals to interact with each other in computer-based virtual environments. In this narrative review, we examine the psychotherapeutic applications of avatars that have been investigated and trialed to date. Five key applications were identified: (1) in the formation of online peer support communities; (2) replicating traditional modes of psychotherapy by using avatars as a vehicle to communicate within a wholly virtual environment; (3) using avatar technology to facilitate or augment face-to-face treatment; (4) as part of serious games, and (5) communication with an autonomous virtual therapist. Across these applications, avatars appeared to serve several functions conducive to treatment engagement: (1) facilitating the development of a virtual therapeutic alliance; (2) reducing communication barriers; (3) promoting treatment-seeking through anonymity; (4) promoting expression and exploration of client identity, and (5) enabling therapists to control and manipulate treatment stimuli. Further research into the feasibility and ethical implementation of avatar-based psychotherapies is required.},

A key component in many video games is the player's avatar; through which the player experiences the game world and game play. Past theory suggests that flow and the identification of a player with their avatar are vital aspects of video games and it is this that differentiates them from other forms of media. However, research on the relationship between flow and avatar/character identification is in its infancy. This study aimed to further examine these two concepts and their relationship within video games. This study consisted of 306 participants, who completed a series of self-report questionnaires online. As hypothesised, it was found that character identification was strongly and positively related to flow. It was also found that only the video game specific characteristics of similarity to character and customisation were negatively and positively related to flow respectively. Furthermore, similarity but not customisation was related to character identification, and that similarity was strongly and positively related to character identification. Other findings include Openness to Experience being positively related to character identification, and Extraversion being negatively related to character identification.},

Variables independently associated with 30-day readmission (forming the mnemonic READMIT) were: (R) Repeat admissions; (E) Emergent admissions (i.e. harm to self/others); (D) Diagnoses (psychosis, bipolar and/or personality disorder), and unplanned Discharge; (M) Medical comorbidity; (I) prior service use Intensity; and (T) Time in hospital. Each 1-point increase in READMIT score (range 0-41) increased the odds of 30-day readmission by 11{\%} (odds ratio 1.11, 95{\%} CI 1.10-1.12). The index had moderate discriminative capacity in both derivation (C-statistic = 0.631) and validation (C-statistic = 0.630) datasets. Determining risk of psychiatric readmission for individual patients is a critical step in efforts to address the potentially avoidable high rate of this negative outcome. The READMIT index provides a framework for identifying patients at high risk of 30-day readmission prior to discharge, and for the development, evaluation and delivery of interventions that can assist with optimizing the transition to community care for patients following psychiatric discharge.},

We found that peer-based interventions facilitated important changes in health-related behaviors, including physical activity, smoking, and condom use, with a small-to medium-sized effect. However, the evidence was mixed, possibly because of the heterogeneity we found in methods, dose, and other variables between the studies.

abstract = {Introduction: Internet based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) represents a significant development in the way psychological interventions are delivered. Studies tend to recruit via common media channels leading to criticisms of biased sample sizes and limited generalisability to primary care settings. Aim: To evaluate the use of a prevalence recruitment strategy within primary care to recruit into an RCT examining a free to use iCBT intervention. Methods: Fully randomised controlled trial (RCT), utilising a prevalence based recruitment strategy, comparing the iCBT intervention with telephone support provided by NHS Direct Health Advisors with treatment-as-usual (TAU) control. Results: Recruitment rates were low with only 7 participants recruited over 8 months. Overall only 14{\%} of expected study invitations were sent, with only 1{\%} undertaking the consent and initial screening process. Discussion: Key differences with successful prevalence recruitment strategies highlight four main issues to consider when recruiting participants from primary care into iCBT studies - lack of equipoise, a need for an assertive approach, coding of depression in GP databases and help seeking behaviour in depression which can all act as potential contributors to failure to recruit. However other non-primary care recruitment methods, such as the use of media channels, which are already shown to be effective in non-primary care settings should be considered if these methods more accurately target the population who would be willing to adopt iCBT more generally. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of the physical similarity of avatars with the user on emotion regulation strategy training. In this study twenty-four teenagers observed an avatar (either physically similar to the participant or neutral) that gets frustrated with his/her computer, after which he/she applies an emotion regulation strategy (slow breathing). The intensity of the emotional induction and regulation processes was measured using questionnaires and electroencephalogram data. The results show that observing an avatar that is physically similar to the participant has a significantly greater impact on emotional valence and arousal in participants and also induces emotional states that are significantly more intense than when observing a neutral avatar. The results seem to indicate significantly greater activation of specific brain regions that are related to these processes and greater identification with the avatar in terms of both subjective and objective measures in participants that observed an avatar that was physically similar to them. However, there were no significant differences in the sense of presence or the appeal (i.e., satisfaction) to participants regarding the virtual environment. The use of avatars in mental health applications is relatively new and its specific influence is still unknown. We consider this study to be a first step forward in better understanding the use of avatars in mental health applications for youth. This research brings new guidelines to the design of different types of applications in this field in order to achieve greater behavioral changes in youth.},

abstract = {Understanding mechanisms underlying smoking-related factors should be prioritized in establishing smoking prevention and cessation policy. The aim of this study was to identify factors significantly associated with smoking initiation and/or smoking cessation as well as the most important determinants of successful smoking cessation in a developed non-Western setting. Based on multiple logistic regression models, the odds ratios (ORs) for smoking initiation and cessation were estimated among males (N = 24,490) who had participated in the Health Examinees (HEXA) study. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the association between selected predictors of smoking cessation and the likelihood of reaching this goal. Finally, Kaplan–Meier curves were constructed to illustrate the distribution of time from age at smoking initiation to age at smoking cessation. We found that the ORs for successfully quitting smoking increased with age, married status, educational achievement, having a non-manual job, drinking cessation and disease morbidity. Those exposed to secondhand smoking showed less likelihood of quitting smoking. A continual decrease in the ORs for successfully quitting smoking was observed according to increased smoking duration, smoking dose per day and lifetime tobacco exposure (ptrend {\textless}0.001). Among the selected predictors, lifetime tobacco exposure, educational attainment, alcohol drinking status and birth cohort were the major determinants in the success of smoking cessation. Our findings suggest that lifetime tobacco exposure, educational attainment, alcohol drinking status and birth cohort can determine success in smoking cessation. Public interventions promoting a smoke-free environment are needed to reinforce discouraging the initiation of, reducing, and quitting cigarette smoking.},

abstract = {Virtual environments, such as online games and web-based chat rooms, increasingly allow us to alter our digital self-representations dramatically and easily. But as we change our self-representations, do our self-representations change our behavior in turn? In 2 experimental studies, we explore the hypothesis that an individual's behavior con-forms to their digital self-representation independent of how others perceive them— a process we term the Proteus Effect. In the first study, participants assigned to more attractive avatars in immersive virtual environments were more intimate with confed-erates in a self-disclosure and interpersonal distance task than participants assigned to less attractive avatars. In our second study, participants assigned taller avatars behaved more confidently in a negotiation task than participants assigned shorter avatars. We discuss the implications of the Proteus Effect with regards to social interactions in online environments. The notion of transforming our appearances permeates our culture. On the one hand, minor alterations such as haircuts, makeup, and dressing up are seen as socially acceptable, if not socially desirable. On the other hand, the ability to truly transform oneself has been regarded in myths and legends as both dangerous and powerful. Consider, for example, werewolves and vampires from Europe, the kitsune (foxes that can take on human form) from Japan, the God Loki from Norse mythology, and the God Proteus from Greek mythology. The Greek God Proteus is notable for being the origin of the adjective ''protean''—the ability to take on many different self-representations. And although extreme self-transformations are expensive (e.g., cosmetic surgery) or difficult to perform (e.g., gender reassignment surgery) on our physical bodies, nowhere is self-representation more flexible and easy to transform than in virtual environments where users can choose or customize their own avatars—digital representations of themselves.

Study 5 revealed significant associations between caregiving representations and parenting attitudes (desire to have a child, feelings toward parenthood, and expectations of self-efficacy as a parent). Overall, the results provide highly consistent evidence for the reliability and validity of the new MRC scale. The implications of individual differences in mental representation of caregiving for prosocial behavior and helping are discussed. Bekkers, R. (2007).

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate whether a new computerised cognitive behavioural therapy intervention (SPARX, Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, X-factor thoughts) could reduce depressive symptoms in help seeking adolescents as much or more than treatment as usual. Design: Multicentre randomised controlled non-inferiority trial. Setting: 24 primary healthcare sites in New Zealand (youth clinics, general practices, and school based counselling services). Participants: 187 adolescents aged 12-19, seeking help for depressive symptoms, with no major risk of self harm and deemed in need of treatment by their primary healthcare clinicians: 94 were allocated to SPARX and 93 to treatment as usual. Interventions: Computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (SPARX) comprising seven modules delivered over a period of between four and seven weeks, versus treatment as usual comprising primarily face to face counselling delivered by trained counsellors and clinical psychologists. Outcomes: The primary outcome was the change in score on the children's depression rating scale-revised. Secondary outcomes included response and remission on the children's depression rating scale-revised, change scores on the Reynolds adolescent depression scale-second edition, the mood and feelings questionnaire, the Kazdin hopelessness scale for children, the Spence children's anxiety scale, the paediatric quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire, and overall satisfaction with treatment ratings. Results: 94 participants were allocated to SPARX (mean age 15.6 years, 62.8{\%} female) and 93 to treatment as usual (mean age 15.6 years, 68.8{\%} female). 170 adolescents (91{\%}, SPARX n=85, treatment as usual n=85) were assessed after intervention and 168 (90{\%}, SPARX n=83, treatment as usual n=85) were assessed at the three month follow-up point. Per protocol analyses (n=143) showed that SPARX was not inferior to treatment as usual. Post-intervention, there was a mean reduction of 10.32 in SPARX and 7.59 in treatment as usual in raw scores on the children's depression rating scale-revised (between group difference 2.73, 95{\%} confidence interval -0.31 to 5.77; P=0.079). Remission rates were significantly higher in the SPARX arm (n=31, 43.7{\%}) than in the treatment as usual arm (n=19, 26.4{\%}) (difference 17.3{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.6{\%} to 31.8{\%}; P=0.030) and response rates did not differ significantly between the SPARX arm (66.2{\%}, n=47) and treatment as usual arm (58.3{\%}, n=42) (difference 7.9{\%}, -7.9{\%} to 24{\%}; P=0.332). All secondary measures supported non-inferiority. Intention to treat analyses confirmed these findings. Improvements were maintained at follow-up. The frequency of adverse events classified as "possibly" or "probably"related to the intervention did not differ between groups (SPARX n=11; treatment as usual n=11). Conclusions: SPARX is a potential alternative to usual care for adolescents presenting with depressive symptoms in primary care settings and could be used to address some of the unmet demand for treatment.

Based on the results of a cross-sectional survey of 544 World of Warcraft players the measurement instrument's proposed factorial structure was confirmed. Subsequently, the constructs were successfully tested both for convergent and discriminant validity. Finally, evidence for nomological validity was gathered by testing ten theoretically rooted hypotheses regarding the effects of Player Identification. The results showed that Avatar Identification positively predicts Empathy, Proteus effect and the motivations role-play, customization and escapism.

abstract = {Unhealthy behaviour is known to lead to obesity and a wide range of health issues, as well as playing a major role in the development and symptomology of mental and physical disorders. Whereas traditional methods of behavioural change require professional attention and are often costly and inefficient, serious health games can be distributed cost-efficiently to a large proportion of the target group. Serious health games are a novel way of combining entertainment with the purpose of changing health-related behaviour. This paper includes a literature review which examines models of behavioural change, the efficacy and methodology of serious health games in achieving them, as well as their limitations. To find out how the theory is applied in practice and to what extent behavioural changes occur, interviews with players of a serious game called “Habitica” have been conducted and first hand experiences have been put in relation to the identified theory. Players of the game successfully achieved and sustained behavioural changes through unconscious application of a range of theoretical models of behavioural change. A big success factor of Habitica is its social aspect, a determinant that has not yet received high levels of attention from the scientific community. Surprisingly, interviewees integrated the game into their lives and keep using it on a daily basis, which serves as a counter example of concerns the scientific community previously voiced over potential relapses and issues with long-term motivation. The theoretical findings and the case of Habitica show that serious health games can be a viable alternative to traditional methods of behavioural health change, even though individuals suffering from health conditions might benefit from further professional treatment. The findings suggest that game developers and researchers can benefit from further looking into social aspects for serious health games.},

@article{Diefenbach2019,
abstract = {The concept of gamification has evoked increasing attention in HCI research and practice. Gamification uses game elements in serious, non-game contexts in order to motivate a particular target behavior or attitude change (e.g., sustainable behavior, physical activity, task management). While gamification has been attributed a high potential, a critical question is whether it actually induces the intended effect. The present research explores ``counterproductive effects of gamification'', i.e., cases when a gamification element does not encourage the intended behavior but rather the opposite (e.g., procrastination instead of getting things done). Studying the example of the gamified task manager Habitica, our paper reports insights from two consecutive studies. Study 1, a qualitative interview study based on interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) with one single user revealed seven themes describing distinct counterproductive effects in Habitica, and additional seven themes related to Habitica's reward/punishment system and psychological reactions to counterproductive effects. Study 2 further explored these findings in a quantitative field study with 45 users over a two-week usage period, also studying correlations to user experience, product evaluation, motivation to play Habitica and individual belief in gamification. All participants experienced counterproductive effects to some degree, whereby some effects (e.g., being punished by Habitica in especially productive times, since one does not manage to check off tasks in time) were more prevalent than others (e.g., relabeling tasks as positive habits with no due date to prevent the risk of punishments). The prevalence of counterproductive effects was correlated to the users' perceived inappropriateness of the reward system, and a crucial predictor for motivation change over time. Relations to psychological mechanisms, general implications for gamification design and future research directions are discussed.},

To explore this, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure changes in hemoglobin density while participants performed a task requiring them to make the opposite emotional facial expression of that presented in a picture. We found that (1) neither surface nor deep acting led to a significant change in hemoglobin concentration in the prefrontal cortex; (2) making negative and positive facial expressions activated the same left front and middle areas of the prefrontal cortex; and (3) making positive facial expressions activated the rear portion of the prefrontal cortex, but making negative facial expressions did not. Based on these findings and past work, we can infer that deep and surface acting may not significantly differ in terms of the activity in the prefrontal cortex energy consumed. Furthermore, engaging in positive and negative emotional labor appear to utilize some of the same neurological mechanisms, although they differ in others.},

Both the masculine culture and the prejudices help explain the paucity of women engineers and predict high levels of burnout among them. Findings – The paper's findings supported this prediction. They revealed a significant gender difference in burnout, with women engineers reporting higher levels of burnout than men. The gender differences in burnout were interpreted as related to other findings: women's greater tendency to utilize emotion-focused coping, their smaller peer support and greater work–family conflict. Originality/value – In addition to their implications for gender theory and research and for burnout theory and research, the paper's findings point to the need to encourage and support the small and unique group of women engineers.

abstract = {Emotions in health organisations tend to remain tacit and in need of clarification. Often, emotions are made invisible in nursing and reduced to part and parcel of 'women's work' in the domestic sphere. It has been argued that there is an emotional division of labour in nursing that is based upon gender and gender stereotypes. Opinions on appropriate and inappropriate emotions shape images of nursing, interpersonal and physical contact with patients, the perceived roles of male and female nurses, and the roles of other health staff such as doctors. The purpose of this exploratory qualitative study is to look at nurse narratives on emotional labour and explore the gendered nature of emotional labour. Data were collected primarily from 16 in-depth and semi-structured interviews with nurses. Divisions of gender and emotion will be analysed in the talk of nurse interviewees. Excerpts from interviews will be presented so as to look at views on the definition, stereotypes, gender and professional divisions of emotional labour. This is important in investigating the minutiae of nurses' emotional labour and its gendered nature, beginning to explore the potential therapeutic value of emotional labour and outlining the centrality of emotional labour in nursing.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, {\textcopyright} 2017 SAGE Publications. It is well understood that men are reticent in seeking help for mental health concerns. In the wake of government-funded campaigns across many Western nations that have sought to address this, noticeably absent have been the active development, promotion, dissemination, and rigorous evaluation of male-centered treatment styles. We argue that next-generation approaches must actively counteract unhelpful stereotypes, instead promoting diverse and healthy masculinities. The current article makes the case for the development of a masculinities model of mental health care, offering recommendations to advance clinical practice and research toward this goal. We propose that updated help-seeking campaigns and clinician training, gender-sensitive service provision, and comprehensive cost analyses will provide the groundwork for such a model to better target the diversity in men and reduce any reluctance to engage with mental health treatment.},

abstract = {In internet culture, lurkers are a special group of website users who regularly login to online communities but seldom post. This study aims to provide an overall understanding of lurkers by explaining the definition of lurkers, discussing the reasons for lurking and providing suggestions on de-lurking. To understand the reason for lurking, this study first explains why people participate in online communities by building an integrated model of motivational factors of online behaviors. This model classifies motivational factors into four categories: the nature of the online community, individual characteristics, the degree of commitment and quality requirement. Based on this model, four types of lurking reasons are identified: environmental influence, personal preference, individual-group relationship and security consideration. Finally, several strategies for motivating participation in online communities are provided, including external stimuli, improved user-friendliness, encouragement of participation and guidance for newcomers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Mehrotra2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Indian Psychiatric Society. The past one decade has witnessed a boom in the availability of Internet-based self-help apps in the field of mental health. Several apps have emerged that aim to provide information and strategies to empower individuals with self-help approaches to deal with issues and concerns related to mental health. A large number of these apps in developing countries are likely to be those which depend entirely on the users to go over the self-help program on their own (unguided internet-based self-help). Only a few apps add a component of periodic professional contact/technical support through phone/email or other means to supplement the self-help strategies suggested in the app that the user is expected to utilize. This scenario poses several challenges in use of unguided self-help apps for mental health. This paper enumerates some of these challenges for potential users of the apps from the perspective of clinicians. These range from difficulties in choosing the right app, limited scope for contextualization, and motivation management to awareness about when to step up to a higher intensity intervention. Despite these challenges, unguided self-help apps can serve important purposes, and hence we propose a few recommendations to address such challenges.},

@article{Demjen2018,
abstract = {This paper argues that a fuller understanding of conversational humour, in all its multifunctional, multifaceted, and heterogeneous nature, could be achieved by conducting at least some conversational humour research from the perspective of complexity theory (an umbrella term covering ‘complex adaptive systems theory', ‘dynamic systems theory', ‘chaos theory', etc.). Complexity theory encourages questions that are not usually asked about conversational humour and provides ways of answering them. It ‘aims to account for how the interacting parts of a complex system give rise to the system's collective behaviour and how such a system simultaneously interacts with its environment' making 'change central to theory and method' (Larsen-Freeman {\&} Cameron 2008: 1). The ‘objects of concern' are no longer entities or things (e.g. the joke, a pun, etc.), but processes, changes and continuities: how do particular jokes, puns or humorous lexemes come into being in a given discourse community, how do their uses and meanings develop? The paper demonstrates the potential of a complexity approach to conversational humour by applying it to one particular manifestation of conversational humour: 235 instances of a running joke centred around the lemma rolo*, in approximately 680,000 words of online peer-support data (2544 forum posts, 47 blogs and blog comments), produced by 97 contributors over a period of 13 months in 2011–2012.},

abstract = {International research has identified young men as reluctant to seek help for mental health problems. This research explored barriers and solutions to professional help seeking for mental health problems among young men living in the North West of Ireland. A qualitative approach, using two focus groups with six participants each and five face-to-face interviews, was conducted with men aged 18 to 24 years (total N = 17). Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Seven key themes of barriers to professional help seeking were identified: "acceptance from peers," "personal challenges," "cultural and environmental influences," "self-medicating with alcohol," "perspectives around seeking professional help," "fear of homophobic responses," and "traditional masculine ideals." Five key themes of solutions to these barriers included "tailored mental health advertising," "integrating mental health into formal education," "education through semiformal support services," "accessible mental health care," and "making new meaning." Interesting findings on barriers include fear of psychiatric medication, fear of homophobic responses from professionals, the legacy of Catholic attitudes, and the genuine need for care. This study offers an in-depth exploration of how young men experience barriers and uniquely offers solutions identified by participants themselves. Youth work settings were identified as a resource for engaging young men in mental health work. Young men can be encouraged to seek help if services and professionals actively address barriers, combining advertising, services, and education, with particular attention and respect to how and when young men seek help and with whom they want to share their problems.},

@article{Schuman2005,
abstract = {According to revisionist historians and American Indian activists, Christopher Columbus deserves condemnation for having brought slavery, disease, and death to America's indigenous peoples. We ask whether the general public's beliefs about Columbus show signs of reflecting these critical accounts, which increased markedly as the 1992 Quincentenary approached. Our national surveys, using several different question wordings, indicate that most Americans continue to admire Columbus because, as tradition puts it, "he discovered America," though only a small number of mainly older respondents speak of him in the heroic terms common in earlier years. At the same time, the percentage of Americans who reject traditional beliefs about Columbus is also small and is divided between those who simply acknowledge the priority of Indians as the "First Americans" and those who go further to view Columbus as a villain. The latter group of respondents, we find, show a critical stance toward modal American beliefs much more broadly. We also analyze American history school textbooks for evidence of influence from revisionist writings, and we consider representations of Columbus in the mass media as well. Revisionist history can be seen as one consequence of the "minority rights revolution" that began after World War II and has achieved considerable success, but the endurance of Columbus's reputation-to a considerable extent even among the minorities who have the least reason to respect him-raises important questions about the inertia of tradition, the politics of collective memory, and the difference between elite and popular beliefs.},
