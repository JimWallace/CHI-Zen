	abstract = {Recovery from addiction is a complex phenomenon. Without a clear and measureable definition, its ambiguity risks hindering the advancement of recovery-oriented practice and research. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) understand the meaning of recovery from the perspective of individuals with lived experience and (2) identify measurement domains to inform the development of a recovery monitoring system. We conducted five semi-structured focus groups and two interviews with individuals 18 years and older who completed an addiction treatment program and were enrolled in aftercare. Participants were asked questions about how they personally defined “successful” recovery. Data were analyzed using a general inductive approach through independent parallel coding. We explored emergent themes including the following: Recovery is a process; abstinence is an important aspect of recovery, but not sufficient; recovery is multidimensional; and, recovery requires ongoing commitment. This study identified measurable recovery-oriented outcomes and methodological considerations to inform future recovery monitoring systems.},
