# Reporting Measurements and Statistics
\label{sec:statistics}

As part of loading this template, the \texttt{siunit} package is loaded, which supports some common requests, like metric units and angles. This template also includes some macros that help with reporting of common elements of HCI papers like display measurements, study designs, and statistical tests. See below for some common examples: 

## Sizes

The \texttt{siunitx} package already has a feature for angles, \ang{45}.

The display resolution was \size[pixels]{1920}{1080}.
The volume of the cube was \sizen[\cm]{13;12;5}.

We performed a 5 (width)\by 2 (distance)\by 2 (angle) factorial ANOVA.


## Summary Statistics

We recruited 20 participants (\ages{23}{51}; \gender{12}{women}, \gender{7}{men}, and \gender{1}{transgender}).
Alternatively: \genderlist{12;7;1}{women, men, and transgender}.

A mean and standard deviation (\mean[\cm]{32.1}, \sd{4.1}) with same units (\msd[pixels]{3.3333333}{0.32}).



## Reporting Statistical Tests

### $p$-values

\p{.03}

### ANOVA \& $F$-statistics

Some made up stats (\F{2}{3}{4.33}, \p{.03}, \etasqp{.67})
Some made up stats (\F{2}{3}{15.33}, \p{.003}, \etasqp{.67}).
Some made up stats (\anovae{2}{3}{4.33}{.03}{.6666667})
Some made up stats (\anovae{2}{3}{15.333333333}{.003}{.6666667})
Some made up stats (\anovae{2}{3}{30.55555}{.0000000055}{0.9666667})

### CHI-Square Test

Here is a chi-square test (\chisquare{33}{3.323}{.000005}).
