As a rule of thumb, if you can show your data with a table, consider doing that first. Tables are quite effective at `showing your data', and are usually easy to interpret. The Vis literature even suggests that tables might be more convincing for a skeptical audience \citep{pandey2014persuasive}!

In terms of table formatting, many of the same principles apply to tables as figures. My advice is to: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Maintain a high Data-Ink Ratio \citep{tufte1983visual}: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Don't use vertical lines
            \item Use horizontal lines sparingly
            \item Use whitespace to help group things together that belong together
        \end{itemize}
    \item Use \texttt{\textbackslash toprule}, \texttt{\textbackslash midrule}, and \texttt{\textbackslash bottomrule} to frame your table
    \item Use the \texttt{[tb!]} flags when declaring the table in \LaTeX to push it to the top or bottom of a page
    \item Use the \texttt{label\{\}} command to give your table a label that you can use later with \texttt{autoref\{\}}
\end{enumerate}

In general, writing tables directly in \LaTeX is a huge pain --- the output is generally \emph{beautiful}, but the input is complicated, and generally not very human-readable. I suggest using an online table generator, like \href{https://www.tablesgenerator.com}{https://www.tablesgenerator.com}, and then fine-tuning the formatting in your document. \autoref{tab:exampletable} is an example from \citet{wallace2013}.
