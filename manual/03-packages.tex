% # \LaTeX\ Packages and Tools

% This template pre-loads a number of different packages by default. 

% Note that the ACM maintains a whitelist of \LaTeX\ packages that are compatible with their TAPS publishing system
% https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/accepted-latex-packages

% - If you check, many of these packages are not listed
% - BUT, I have confirmed via email that many of them, like PGFPlots, are compatible even if not listed.
