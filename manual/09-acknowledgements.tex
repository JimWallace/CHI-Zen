# Acknowledgements

This template is a compilation of common mistakes, reviewer feedback, and paper writing experience. It is intended to help identify the `little things' that often get in the way of a successful CHI submission, and may be helpful in reviewing your paper \textit{well before} the deadline. For example, to guide peer reviews, such as reviewing circles, or to help communicate necessary revisions. 

While I compiled the different examples, tips, and hacks in one place, they incorporate the experience, advice, and feedback from many others I've worked with, including (in alphabetical order): Robert Gauthier, Mark Hancock, Lennart Nacke, Adrian Reetz, Stacey Scott, and Dan Vogel. Suggestions are always welcome, please email to \href{mailto:james.wallace@uwaterloo.ca}{james.wallace@uwaterloo.ca}.
